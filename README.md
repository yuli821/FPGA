# ECE385 Final Porject: Adventure game

## Description:

A platform game developed on DE10-Lite board. In this project, we had implemented the USB port for keyboard, I2S and I2C for audio output, and mostly, the VGA sprite drawing. We spent most of the time on animation of the sprite, and I hope I can interface with more on-board features in the later development, maybe add external hardware.
